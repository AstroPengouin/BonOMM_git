GFITSIO 4.1 - November 2007

The GFITSIO library is written and maintained by George Gatling at the
Space Physics Simulation Chamber at the Naval Research Laboratory in
Washington DC.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

System Requirements:

- Windows 2000/XP 32-bit  (GFITSIO will not run on 64-bit platforms.)
- NI LabVIEW 8.5 or later.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

In the following instructions "../LabVIEW x.x/" refers to the location
where LabVIEW is installed.  Replace x.x with the your version of LabVIEW.
For example, with a default installation of LabVIEW 8.5 this would be:
"C:\Program Files\National Instruments\LabVIEW 8.5\".  

1.  Exit LabVIEW.
2.  If you have installed a previous version of GFITSIO delete the folder
"../LabVIEW x.x/user.lib/gfitsio"
2.  Unzip "gfitsio-4.1.zip" to ../LabVIEW x.x/user.lib/  This will create
a folder called ../LabVIEW x.x/user.lib/gfitsio that contains the GFTSIO library.
3.  Restart LabVIEW.  

There should be a new menu in the "User Libraries" pallette containing
the GFITSIO library.
